Scarface,"One Word: PERFECT!!!!!!! Scarface has a great storyline, brutal violence as well as having Al Pacino at one of his finest roles. Scarface is one of the best gangster dramas!",positive
Scarface,"Grandiose, bloodyminded and implacable. This is one of my all time favorites. If the movie has a flaw, it's that it comes at you like a raging bull. It doesn't so much engage the viewer as assault him. ''Scarface'' is as voracious and unyielding a production as Tony Montana himself. Nothing is left to the viewer's imagination. Moroder's languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee. Like the chorus in a Greek tragedy, it wails and gnashes, broods and tugs, a constant reminder of Tony's inexorable fate. Not so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress, ''Scarface'' rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train.",positive
Scarface,"highly overrated. Everyone has heard of this movie. The general assumption is that this movie is one of the greatest gangster films that there is. I am inclined to disagree with this. Yes this movie has some great moments, but it does not deserve the credit it gets.
Al Pacino is a great actor, and I don't deny this, but there are to many times in this movie where he seems to overplay the part. Michelle Pfiefer is horrible in this movie, probably her worst performance ever. As for most of the other actors who did not make it big, it is very much because they're not good actors. Al Pacino's brother in the movie seems totally scripted.
Anyway, as for the plot, it is boring, and overused. Man gets rich, and the people he stepped on to get there come after him. It's boring and predictable because of this. If I were doing this movie, I would cut so much. We don't need the restaurant scenes which do not advance the movie. We do not need a scene with Al pacino in a hot tub having the same argument he had around 5 other times in the movie.",negative
Scarface,"The movie that wasn't a movie... It is nice to see the likes of Oliver Stone, Brian DePalma, Al Pacino, and even Michelle Pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage. It is nice to see people so rich and 'successful' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable, trite, and pathetic pieces of film-making of all time. This movie represents the worst of Hollywood.

What is this? Is it based on a true story. Well, they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off USA today. But then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the American drug subculture; kind of like Rocky on cocaine. Is it a movie about Cuba or Cubans? For the life of me I don't believe there is a single Cuban in this movie. The accents are totally fake, and scene with Antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest American values. The whole scene looks like something out of the Dick Van Dyke show. Is this movie about Miami? It looks more like L.A. transposed in Florida. Afterall, a palm tree is a palm tree. Is this a romance novel. The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo, and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other. Is this a drug movie? Well, no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned. The behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water. Admittedly, the acting is terrible.

Let's get to the rest. The music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a Lawrence Welk show. I think I heard a polka? The camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective. Clearly, the photography budget was excessive. The sound is bleached in a number of spots, and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse. The writing is appalling. This is one of those movies were the script writes itself. You are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next, each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks.

So I am going to ask, Is this even a movie? It could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours. But at least a drama series has some kind of focus. Maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together. Whatever it is, movie or not, it is a piece of crap.",negative
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,"The Boy Who Loved ""Star Wars"" A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original ""Star Wars"" film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first ""Star Wars"" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).

I can't review ""Star Wars"" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to ""Star Wars"" and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Trek"" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.

I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.

Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+",Positive
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,"The most peculiar Star Wars and under appreciated. Totally should've won at least some of the awards it was nominated for! A very different adventure story with lots of adorable characters, more truths and the epic Emperor Palpatine! I love all the majestic forest aspects. Still crazy to me that they filmed so many parts especially the chases. The bulk of this art in cinema is done so well and always entertaining. Quite lovable many years later and not many movies have that kind of force!",Positive
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,"Uhhgg! Spoilers: I remember looking so forward to this as a kid after loving the first two movies. They had previews for new characters on the back of the action figures boxes I'd get at Toys-R-Us and I'd eagerly wonder what the blacked out Ewok characters would look like. Must have really been something special! I even remember how they switched the name around as ""Revenge of the Jedi."" This was just going to be THE movie of the summer, and waiting in line to get in while hearing the thunderous noise of the climactic battle as the audience of the screening just wrapping up applauded enthusiastically, I was just SO excited. When I saw it even as a kid I knew it was somewhat of a disappointment, watching it now as an adult...Uhgg! Now I see how Lucas went so wrong with the abomination of the prequels, all the threads started to unravel with this Turkey. (Though Return of the Jedi is still much superior to those aforementioned prequels which had a plot harder to follow than Dune.) First of all are notoriously unbearable Ewoks, even as a kid I HATED them. No adult could possibly find anything watchable about the whole Ewok sequence on Endor. The Emperor is ridiculously ""comic book"" evil, tyrants usually have charisma and are more like gangsters than lunatics. The choice to add another family revelation by making Leah Luke's sister is stupid and ruins the relationship from the first two movies. The original Cantina scene with the various aliens was creative, here Lucas has gone overboard with a new bizarre rubber masked actor or puppet cropping up every minute. In some respects this whole thing is nothing more than a commercial to sell action figures to eight year olds. And the Climax: Another Deathstar? Lucas, you already did that before, but considering the fecal ideas he spewed out in the prequels, perhaps a rehashing of the end of the first movie was the best we could hope for. After all, to sum up the cinematic ideas going through Lucas' head during this period: Howard the Duck. Don't even get me started on the vandalism Lucas did to the Original Trilogy with the CGI additions to the new copys of the Star Wars movies for sale. The original 1977 print is a piece of American History, to alter the imagery that swept the nation that summer is akin to someone painting over the Mona Lisa.

Still Return of the Jedi it did have it's moments. The Jabba the Hut character is ubiquitously reknown and to this day everyone knows what your talking about if you refer to any gluttonous tard as ""Jabba the Hut."" The chase scene through the Redwoods is also quite memorable although the excitement came to a quick end with the ridiculously infantile Ewok scenes beginning moments later. The final showdown between Luke and Vader was also a glimpse of what this movie could have been had the same people who worked on The Empire Strikes Back had control over this thing. On the whole, a disappointing, childish end to the first two movies.",negative
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,"Easily my least favorite of the first three films. WAY too much cutesy-poo, some below-par special effects, and the *worst* extras in the business -- remember the guy who says ""You Rebel Scum?"" How about 87 different Imperials saying ""Freeze! -- Don't move!"" at different points? What is this, a bad 70's cop show?
I have heard rumors that Lucas originally planned to have Endor populated by Wookies, which would have been *far* more interesting than those obnoxious little Ewoks, who simply stretched my credulity past the breaking point. I mean, the Storm Troopers have *helmets* on -- yet a 3-foot teddy bear with a stick can take one down with a couple of ineffectual whacks to the head? Please...",negative
The A-Team,"One of the best 80s shows ever.
80s shows were the best and this was defiantly in the top 3. Takes you back to a time when people wasn't a bunch of fairy's and didn't get offended for the simpliest of things. The theme tunes were second to none not like the rubbish these days. Dukes of Hazzard, Knight Rider, Battlestar Galactica, Street Hawk, The Fall Guy, Quantum Leap, Magnum PI, Macguyver, Buck Rogers all classics.",positive
The A-Team,"Action show that is a cartoon
The A-Team is pure silly and pretentious as it struggles to be a good action series and hear is the justification for my claim based upon long analysis and evidence. First of all i do not expect Shakespeare but a good action show with a stable scenario. The only positive thing i can say is that the Van was iconic. Besides from that the characters are too juvenile and foolish to be ex-Vietnam vets(notably Mr T) along with pseudo-crime based story lines with cheesy action. If they were mercenaries it would be more believable but that would contradict their roles as Robin Hood figures leaving them vulnerable to corruption not good for television heroes. Firstly every crime they tackle they would of been easily caught or head hunted and secondly they would of not done a service for nothing unless their was personal gain rather then sentimentality. If the A-team had been an American independent copy of the British series the Professionals it would have a stable theme basis that would be dramatically coherent and an action show that deals in high crime rather then Police mainstream crime with hard action, hardy deep characters, good story lines, fast cars and the late George Peppard as their boss and perhaps done earlier then when it originally came out when action shows like this where more at there height",negative
Risky Business,"A Stylish and Intelligent Comedy that redefined the teen angst comedy and created a new movie star
RISKY BUSINESS is the smart and sexy 1983 teen comedy that brought intelligence to the genre and made a bonafide movie star out of Tom Cruise. Cruise is utterly winning as Joel Goodson, a high school senior excited about the prospect of having the house to himself when his parents go out of town for a few days; but things go from bad to worse when Joel crosses paths with a nubile prostitute (Rebecca DeMornay). This surprise hit brought an element of sophistication that was absent from a lot of the teen comedies that were populating the screen in the 1980's. This movie boasts a smart screenplay, imaginative direction, a memorable musical score, and on-target performances from Cruise, DeMornay, Curtis Armstrong, Joe Pantoliano (memorable as a slimy pimp), Bronson Pinchot, and Janet Carroll. Tom's sexy underwear dance to ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" has become Hollywood folklore. An instant classic upon release that still holds up over 20 years later.",positive
Risky Business,"There is an upside to being a bad actor in America
The upside to being a bad actor, in America, is that that the movie industry is structured as a business. And like any business there is a product they want to sell to you. In order to sell the product they need advertising, and this is where the star-system steps in. In order to sell a movie to the American target audience you need a ""typical American looking"" leading actor, which will be quoted like a commodity(this quote will determine the further use of him to endorse another product). And this explains why a not so good looking, next door looking guy like Tom Cruise, who can't act, gets the lead in movies. He is backed up in his performance by other, talented, not next-door material actors, but with strong personality(in this case Bronson Pinchot, Curtis Armstrong and Joe Pantoliano). The American movie business calls them ""comic relief"" characters, but in fact that means they are not destined to make it big in the business. Well, the only comic thing I find about all that is that luck (because the way you look is destiny) can put a bad actor on top of the pyramid. Only in America.",negative
The Outsiders,"Great Movie and Accurate Adaptation.
I had to read the book in seventh grade and we also watched the movie. I though both of them were fabulous. Francis Ford Coppola has adapted almost every detail of the book into this movie. I thought the acting was great and the plot was good for teenagers, which is the movie's, as well as the book's, target audience. I was surprised on how many stars were in this movie (seven) and it was much better than I thought it would be. It didn't seem cheesy and small but you felt like you were watching a real film. Even though the Greasers seem to be born into undesirable lives, watching this movie makes you want to go back to 1967 in the Southwest and be a Greaser, too. Fabulous movie and perfect for teenagers.",positive
The Outsiders,"I did not like this movie.
I found this movie was very boring. The acting was not the greatest and it did not follow the book very well. I did not enjoy the book either so the movie was just not exciting for me to watch. The characters were very well chosen and did a good job of portraying their characters. Personally I was not fond of the characters even though it was based off of a book. I found the gang fights really the only exciting part which is quite sad. When pony boy and Johnny ran away to the church, I found that part not too terrible but over all I disliked the movie a lot. I just found that it was a waste of time to sit and watch the whole movie. So many people say it is a very good movie but as someone from a younger generation I do not find it very good.",negative
WarGames,"Ahead of it's time.
Wargames was a movie that was way ahead of its time. No one was making films about hacking into computer systems. The only computers used in movies were on space ships. No home computer has ever really been brought to the big screen. Wargames broke from the normal studio sci fi norm of either Earth being visited by aliens (E.T) or battles of Good and Evil in space (Star Wars, Star Trek). With the raise in hacker crime rate now, and seeing how Dependant we've become on computers, Wargames was a movie with it the eye on the future. Imaginative story, great cast (who, despite other reviews, do not phone it in) Wargames is a true gem, as it was recently listed by AFI as one of the top 100 sci fi movies of all time. Broderick was perfect as a slacker teen, and Ally Sheedy turns in one of her best performance, making the most of an under developed character. Dabney Coleman showed why he was one of the busiest actors in the 1980's (though he always better cast as a villain), and Barry Corbin could play almost anything convincingly. while the special effects may be dated by todays standard, Wargames helped shape the way people think and speak. Backdoors, hacking, were not common terms like they are today. Without a doubt, much in agreement with AFI, Wargames remains one of the most important films ever made.",positive
WarGames,"Doesn't hold up.
I loved this film when I was thirteen years old. Personal computers were just becoming available to average people and, as kids, we were fascinated by them. We were also starting to get an understanding of cold war politics. I don't say that this movie doesn't hold up because it is dated. That is what still makes it worth watching. It doesn't hold up because the storytelling style and staging are just plain silly. The second and third acts are not remotely believable even for sci-fi.",negative
Trading Places,"Murphy and Aykroyd are Perfect!
When it comes to great comic films, nobody recalls the magic between Murphy and Aykroyd in Trading Places. In the early 80's Eddie Murphy was considered the funniest black comedian next to Richard Pryor. Dan Aykroyd was one of the all time great cast members of Saturday Night Live. Both actors started on SNL and were ready to make their career in films. Trading Places is an example of a perfect comedy. It is funny yes, but there is so much more. With its story, the acting, and the political, racial, and economical plots in the film add to its greatness. One of the best comedies to come out of the 1980's, it stands as one of Eddie Murphy's best earlier films as well as Aykroyd's performances as a character actor. A wonderful and somewhat good family film. If you're that kind of family that is.",positive
Trading Places,"Pop Culture Thoughts
Woof. On the one hand I'll be the first to admit that well-regarded mainstream comedies from the 1980s often confuse me, as I can never quite ascertain exactly why they're considered above the fray. This is particularly true of this Eddie Murphy / Dan Aykroyd vehicle, which somehow manages to reach a two-hour running time without delivering many jokes or amusing set-pieces, basically limping from scene to scene until the endless running time finally wraps up. There's little to no character development for either main character, never giving the audience a reason to care about either beyond the fact that they're played by Murphy and Aykroyd (although, referring to Aykroyd's appearance here as a performance would be rather generous). It's particularly galling that, for a screenplay that routinely subverts white racism for laughs, it seems to have no problem with Murphy's rampant homophobia and misogyny: Women in particular are treated extraordinary poorly by the screenplay, functioning either as mean-spirited gold-diggers or ""empowered"" street prostitutes. Anyways, before I ramble more about how much I hated this movie, let's just leave it at that: I hated this movie.",negative
The Dead Zone,"Great film from start to finish, but not a ""horror movie""
Warning: Spoilers
David Cronenberg's ""The Dead Zone"" is certainly one of the best -- if not THE best -- adaptations of any Stephen King novel on film. It holds up as well now as it did on its premiere over twenty years ago. Among its strengths are Jeffrey Boam's screenplay -- this adaptation catches all the essentials of King's story (losing only some of the mood-setting backstories), cuts some of the novel's dross, and adds a few spot-on creative tweaks of its own (e.g. the references to Poe and Irving, quite appropriate given hero Johnny Smith's profession).

The acting is excellent throughout, from the starring roles down through smaller parts such as the hero's parents. I also love the moody, haunting score by Michael Kamen, which is a masterly adaptation of, and variation on, a theme from the second symphony of Finnish composer Jean Sibelius.

Be forewarned, however, that ""The Dead Zone"" is no horror movie in the sense of featuring vampires, ghosties, werewolves, or zombies. It might be called a thriller or even, loosely, science fiction, in the sense that it operates from the hypothetical ""what-if?"" premise of precognition, or seeing into the future. It could even be called a tragedy. There is certainly a terrible sense of loss over the star-crossed love of Johnny and Sarah at the end of this doom-laden story.",positive
The Dead Zone,"If you like the book, you'll hate the movie
I understand that movies have a difficult time including all of the detail that a full length novel can provide. However, this particular movie leaves out so much detail that it is hard to follow. I read the book prior to viewing the movie and was extremely disappointed by the vagueness of the movie. Christopher Walken is a great actor, however, his ""creepiness"" was not the image that the book portrays the character to have. I would love to see this movie redone correctly because the story line is actually quite interesting. My advice........ watch the movie first and then read the book. It might spoil the outcome for the constant reader, but you will leave with a good taste of the story as opposed to being upset that you watched the movie at all.",negative
The Big Chill,"Great movie!!
After reading several of the user comments on this movie, it is clear that many people missed quite a bit. Those ""funny one-liners"" (and there are plenty!) are much more than that: they tell us volumes about the characters. This movie certainly does not spell anything out to the viewer (except, perhaps, the obvious), so you must be able to find the meaning behind the words. If you listen to what the characters are saying, then you can understand their past relationships, their present feelings, which friends have stayed close, etc. Remember, these are old friends: the script is very realistic so the characters are not going to explain every line to one another. I believe to truly enjoy this movie you need to pay close attention to all of the details and understand a bit about the attitudes and ideals of the two eras the movie depicts.

Wonderful, intelligent movie!",positive
The Big Chill,"The Big Yawn
We all know this movie by it's reputation as one of the so-called icons of the Yuppie 80s, and as such I was expecting a lot more than the movie delivered. I sat through the whole thing waiting for something even remotely interesting to happen. Nothing ever did. Bluntly put, it's an overblown, self-important piece of yuppie garbage which might serve as a cure for insomnia but as a movie it's pig swill. None of the characters have any basis in reality, nor do any of them evoke even the slightest bit of empathy(although to be fair the acting-along with the soundtrack saves this movie from being a total catastrophe. There isn't a bad performance to be found here) These aren't exactly people you'd want to hang with.

This movie also got a lot of publicity for having edited Kevin Costner's performance completely out. Lucky guy that Kevin. Don't waste your time or money.",negative
Christine ,"Keith Gordan and John Stockwell shine in this classic horror movie
Ah, do I remember the day that I saw Christine, which is disturbing since I was only 6 years old, but my sister said ""Do you wanna watch Christine?"" and I was confused, my name is Kristine, but she told me about this little horror movie and thanks to her I couldn't go near our family car for a few months. This is a movie that has always stayed with me and still scares the heck out of me when I watch it in the dark. Who knew that even before taking a driver's ed class that cars could scare me? But this isn't just any ordinary car, this is a killer car! This is a car with ghosts in it and you wouldn't like them if you make them angry or try to take their owner away. Christine is the car that you definitely don't wanna mess with, otherwise you may have to face those bright lights and loud rock and roll music, what happens next, you may not wanna know.

Arnie Cunningham, a typical high school nerd with only one friend, a childhood companion named Dennis Guilder, a popular jock. Arnie's life begins to change when he discovers Christine, a red 1958 Plymouth Fury in serious need of repair. Arnie begins to restore Christine to her original beauty, but as he spends more and more of his time repairing her, those in his life notice that he is changing as well. Formerly shy, Arnie develops a cocky arrogance. Dennis, as well as Arnie's new girlfriend Leigh, discover that the car has a deadly past. The previous owner, Roland LeBay, became consumed with Christine and he paid for it with his life. Leigh and Dennis try to save Arnie from a similar fate. They realize that the only way to save Arnie is by destroying Christine. Christine, however, isn't ready to give up Arnie without a fight.

Christine is a classic horror movie that for me will always deliver on the good scares. I still have a hard time watching it. I think the scariest scene for me will always be the last scene where Leigh and Dennis face off with Christine and you see that Arnie just completely gone. I'm honestly shocked that Keith Gordon didn't continue on with his acting career, he just blew me away as Arnie, reading the book I couldn't picture anybody else. He's absolutely incredible. John Stockwell also pulls in a good solid performance as well. This is one of the rare horror movies that is over all very enjoyable and if it doesn't scare you, I still think you will like it, it has a great story and a very good cast and crew. I highly recommend that you see this movie if you get the chance, it's a classic.",positive
Christine ,"Not all Novels Make Good Movies

In a way, Stephen King and John Carpenter deserve each other. Each has produced an uneven body of work. Halloween, for instance, despite its forced sequels, was a truly heart-pounding thriller. The Thing was a gross-out bomb. Christine stands, in my opinion, as King's most enduring work. By contrast, Pet Semetary was also a gross-out bomb. John Carpenter's movie version of Christine is somewhere in the middle between success and failure. It is successful because, even if one hasn't read the book, a viewer will stick with it simply to find out how everything turns out. It is a failure because it tries to use shorthand to fill in for the material that made King's novel worthwhile. In interviews with this DVD both Carpenter and writer Bill Phillips proclaim that they decided to eliminate the Roland D. LeBay back story in favor of making the car the centerpiece. They try to fill in by introducing LeBay's brother, George, as a sort of surrogate, right down to Roland's filthy back brace. Readers will connect the brace with the Roland character in the novel, but in the film it merely distracts from the rest of the scene. They also try to fill in by crafting a completely original opening assembly line sequence that supposedly introduces the evil that is present in the car that would one day be called Christine. This one decision loses the impact of the novel, whose point is that the evil which possessed the car came from Roland LeBay's own poisoned soul--and that evil persisted after his death. By placing the evil in an inanimate object (and then attempting to persuade us that car is somehow alive) Carpenter and Phillips cause us to cease to care. Each of us has dealt with inanimate objects which appear to have a will of their own, but Christine is stretches us beyond the limit. The deleted scenes included with the 2003 release show evidence that, in limited ways, Carpenter and Phillips understood this. For instance, in one hospital scene, Dennis has Arnie sign his cast. In a deleted scene, occurring a bit later, Dennis asks for another signature. The point, of course, is that the two are completely different. Arnie is possessed by the evil soul of Roland LeBay. The minutes devoted to the opening sequence should have been used to flesh out this back story.

Readers of the novel know that King set the story in a working-class suburb of Pittsburgh. The complexity of that setting is itself a kind of character. Within minutes, we discover that the movie is set in California, a part of America that most Pittsburghers would perceive as particularly shallow. Carpenter undoubtedly did this to avoid extensive winter sequences, including one particularly brutal blizzard. It's but another short cut that trivializes the story.

King's novel is a highly effective meditation on the persistence of evil. The movie inspires no terror and no dread. It isn't even particularly humorous. Instead, we stay with it just to see how it comes out. The great strength of King's novel is that it was about people and only marginally about the car. In casting unknowns, and then buying 24 1958 Plymouths, Carpenter asked us to focus on the car. It doesn't work. Here is my proposal: Let's ask Frank Darabont to take a run at a remake. He did a wonderful job with the King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption (shortened to The Shawshank Redemption for the film) and the serial novel The Green Mile. Those films work because Darabont took King's work seriously in terms of time and place, and because he took the time to develop the characters. A remake of Christine at Darabont's hands, at about the same length as Shawshank or Green Mile, would be worth seeing.",negative
Twilight Zone: The Movie,"Hit and Miss
As is the case with movie anthologies, ""Twilight Zone - The Movie"" is hit and miss. If there was a movie destined to have four short stories that were all home runs it was this one. But the film falls short partially due to the expectations of the fans of the TV show and partially due to the fans expectations of the results of the four directors. What was most interesting back in 1983 was which ones hit and which ones missed.

The prologue gets things going in the right direction with Albert Brooks and Dan Aykroyd as two guys traveling down a dark and seemingly lonely road. What transpires in pure Twilight Zone. Then we move into the first story which is directed by (as was the opening prologue) John Landis. Landis, who got the whole project off the ground, foolishly decided to go with an original story instead of updating a classic episode. His story is that of a bigot who constantly and bitterly complains about the minorities who are getting job promotions and moving into his neighborhood. Of course the bigot then gets a real taste of what it feels like to be frowned upon as a minority. Basically that is the whole story in a nutshell. Landis provides no real twists to his story to give us that Twilight Zone flavor after the first few minutes. Once we see where the story is headed it never changes directions. For film buffs Landis adds a nice touch with a subtle reference to his classic ""Animal House"" in the Vietnam section of the story. Of course it should be noted that this was the story being shot when Vic Morrow and two children were tragically killed which would explain its abrupt ending. The two children are never seen which would suggest perhaps Landis had more to tell but we'll never know. Of the four this is the weakest story.

Story two is not much better then the first which is particularly surprising since Steven Spielberg is at the helm for this one. It's a remake of ""Kick the Can"" which was not one of my favorite episodes from the series and Spielberg adds nothing to his version. It's the tale of residents of an old folks home who encounter a new resident who promises them something no one of this Earth could possibly give them. While the story and individual moments are very sweet it goes absolutely nowhere. Having just come off ""E.T."" perhaps Spielberg was in that same gushy mood at that time.

Story three picks things up drastically and heads us in the right direction. Directed by Joe Dante who, at that time, was best known for ""The Howling"" with films such as ""Gremlins"" still in his future, this is the story of a little boy who hears people's thoughts and has a way of ""wishing people away"" if he gets angry enough at them. Kathleen Quinlan plays an unsuspecting traveler who goes to the boy's home and realizes almost immediately things are not normal. The star of this story is the art direction and sets as we are transformed into almost cartoon like worlds that are both funny and frightening.

The last and best story is the tale of a frightened airline passenger (well played by John Lithgow) who threatens the safety of everyone when he seems to be the only person that sees a creature on the wing of the airplane. George Miller, best known for the ""Mad Max"" movies, was smart enough to pick a popular episode from the series and he delivers with a bang. When you leave the theater this is the story you remember most.

On the whole the film is worth watching especially after the first 45 minutes. Landis and Spielberg perhaps were a little too high on their horses and thought whatever they did would work. Apparently they under estimated the legions of Zone fans. I'd love to see someone try another Twilight Zone movie someday and try re-working some of the other most famous episodes. I should also mention the terrific musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. Its one of his least mentioned but I think it's one of his best.",positive
Twilight Zone: The Movie,"This should have been better
Looking past the accident, I can't really understand why this is not a good movie. Four brilliant directors, all given the opportunity to make Twilight Zone episodes with a movie-like budget. A number of great actors involved. How come the result is lackluster and lacking of charm? The old Twilight Zone TV-series obviously owes part of it's charm to the era it was made in, but it's also full of stories, some quite silly, that all take themselves seriously. There's twists at the end of the episodes that you some times can see from miles away, but that at other times makes you admit that it was clever. There's tons of bad episodes, but the package itself is still brilliant.

Then there's this movie. The first story lacks a proper ending (something that's due to the accident), making the rest of it feel pointless. The second story is visually beautiful, but feels both predictable and rushed. I would have thought that this sort of project would bring out the best in Spielberg, but he chooses a story that's only OK, and doesn't manage to portray in a way that transcends the silly story that it is. The third film is one of the more famous TZ-episodes, and the updates done to the story mostly works. I loved this due to the special effects that were used, but the acting and the story left some to be desired. The last one, also a famous one, is probably the best of the four. Had all four of them been this interesting on a story level, the movie would have been a lot better.

I would love for them to have another go at this. Especially Spielberg and Miller has proved many times what they are capable of, and I'm sure TZ (and those sort of stories) still mean a lot to them. Oh well.

Krull,"A gem from the Fantasy Boom of the 80's
This has always been one of my favorite movies for some reason. That doesn't necessarily mean that it's good; just that I like watching it.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone searching for a good fantasy title from the 80's. I would put ""Krull"" right up there with Ladyhawke, both Conan's, Willow, and the Dark Crystal.

What separates this fantasy film from the others is a plot involving a more science fiction- type element. Visitors from somewhere in space have landed on a planet named Krull to wreak havoc. After they snag up our hero, Prince Colwyn's bride-to-be, he goes on a quest to save her with the help of a star-shaped boomerang with knives called the Glaive and a band of strange characters including a cyclops and a goofy guy who can change into animals.

Good time fun worth the rental price. What else do you need here?

For film buffs, check out early performances by Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane.",positive
Krull,"Why you MUST give Krull a second look.
'Fantasy', in the traditional 'Dungeons & Dragons' sense, in the movies is often seen by the general public as a warning sign (and often rightly so). On the surface, Krull does seem like standard fantasy cliche. Prince must rescue princess from monster. Not very promising so far, is it? Already starting to lose interest? YOU FOOLS! Consider these additional elements: An orchestral soundtrack by the mighty James Horner (Titanic), which is possibly the best score he has ever written, possibly even THE best score ever written; A brilliant mostly-British cast, including Liam Neeson, Robbie Coltrane, Tucker Jenkins :) and a host of other distinguished actors; A script which is so corny that it cannot fail to be fantastic when delivered with such hammed-up enthusiasm by the actors; and finally a few brilliant touches such as the boyhood-dream-weapon the Glave - a giant mind-controlled shuriken. This film falls in to the same category as Flash Gordon which was released a few years before - epic, brit-centric, totally entertaining masterpieces of camp grandeur. Don't write it off until you've seen it enough to appreciate its subtleties.",positive
Krull,"Destined to be remembered with fondness for years to come.
This movie is half way between being so bad, it's good and being so good, it's er...good. It's neither too camp, nor badly acted, nor does it have any really dire special effects. But then again, the acting isn't brilliant nor are the effects stunning (except for the spider, which is pretty good).

In short, it's OK.

The hero's main weapon is a kind of giant shuriken-thing which slices through almost anything. It's also under his mental control, which is nice, but as he's non-too bright we don't get to see any of the really wicked things you COULD do with a flying circular saw if you had an imagination.

The cast has a few well-known names in it. Liam Neeson, for example, in his early years. The things actors do before they become famous.

There's also my fave bad actor, Bernard Bresslaw. Sadly, his bad acting is hampered by a dodgy facial prosthetic which hides half his face. So we are not treated to his usual silliness and clown-like mugging. Instead we have to endure the presence of his cyclop's prosthetic throughout the movie. And trust me, it ain't very convincing. Imagine a one-eyed giant whose face has been frozen through Botox abuse and you'll get the idea.

And there's the evil Beast, which the cast are trying to destroy. Apparently it doesn't have legs, and is trapped inside it's fortress. All it can do is blow fireballs at the hero, which are pretty ineffectual. I actually felt a bit sorry for it. The final fight scene was rather like watching someone beat up a disabled person.

But on the whole this movie is alright and destined to be remembered with fondness for years to come.",negative
